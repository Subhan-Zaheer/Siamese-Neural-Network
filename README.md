# Siamese Neural Network

The Siamese Neural Network is a type of neural network architecture used for tasks involving similarity measurement or verification between input data.
It consists of two identical neural networks, commonly referred to as twin networks, which are joined together at their outputs. 
This architecture is particularly effective in scenarios where the amount of labeled data is limited.
